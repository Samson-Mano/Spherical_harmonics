# Spherical Harmonics

## Overview
The **Spherical Harmonics** project is designed to study the mode shapes and behavior of 3D spherical shells using the **Legendre Polynomial Mode Shape Method**. This project uses modern OpenGL (GLSL) to render the sphere and visualize various spherical harmonic mode shapes in real time, allowing users to explore the behavior of spherical shells with ease.

### Key Features
- **Solve Spherical Harmonics**: Compute spherical harmonic modes for thin 3D shells.
- **Mode Shape Visualization**: Visualize the mode shapes in a 3D interactive interface.
- **Pulse Loading Response (WIP)**: Analyze the 3D shell's response to pulse loading (currently in progress).
- **Efficient Rendering**: The project uses OpenGL for fast and efficient rendering of spherical modes.


## User Interface (UI) Controls

The user interface offers various control options for easy interaction:

- **Pan**: Hold `Ctrl` and right-click drag to pan.
- **Rotate**: Hold `Ctrl` and left-click drag to rotate.
- **Zoom In/Out**: Hold `Ctrl` and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom.
- **Zoom Fit**: Press `Ctrl + F` to fit the view to the screen.
- **Selection**: Hold `Shift` and left drag to select objects.
- **Deselection**: Hold `Shift` and right drag to deselect objects.

These controls allow smooth interaction with the 3D visualizations.

## Contributions

This project is open for contributions, and there are several areas where improvements can be made:

- **Transparency Issue**: The current transparency routine for the contour plots is not functioning properly, resulting in fully opaque visualizations. Contributions are welcome to improve this feature.
- **Pulse Loading Analysis**: The feature to evaluate the response of the spherical shell to pulse loading is a work in progress.

### How to Contribute:
- Fork the repository and submit a pull request.
- Open an [issue](https://github.com/Samson-Mano/Spherical_harmonics/issues) to report bugs or suggest features.
